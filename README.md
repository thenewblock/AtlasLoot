Edit for AtasLoot that aims to sort the addon through progressive patching.

Remember to remove the - and anything after on the folder. Github automatically adds the version number to the folder, so just make sure the folder you put into addons is named exactly as AtlasLoot

If you have the addon Atlas and it says it isn't compatible download this one:
https://github.com/laytya/Atlas
